Audited 2026-09-09. Source/test evidence ends at revision
`cc658db98ebb858b22edfc451c25f3985d71013c`; this documentation-only task cannot use its own later commit as source-test evidence.

## Maintainer start

Read the architecture map, then use the runbook for current setup, build, launch,
and acceptance commands. A fresh clone lacks the separate `companion/comp2026`
checkout. Verify its intended revision before a Phase 3 build; a mission log or score alone is not a pass.

## Verified behavior and limits

| Evidence | Physical mission | Score | Terminal artifacts | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Accepted competition baseline](verification/comp2026-mvp.md), run `3dc895c3-a5aa-4651-a893-d21884fa43f5` | Returned Home and disarmed in the accepted 600-second run | 150/150 | `COMPLETED`; accepted bundle | Historical external evidence; does not prove current source or images |
| [Payload timestamp verification](payload-timestamp-fix.md), run `259863d9-c558-4102-ae34-fe6c31f5cf94` | Completed all three payloads and Home | 150/150 | `FAILED`; terminal artifacts invalid after a later downward-range timestamp/grid fault | Proves the recorded physical flight, not a full-window pass |

Run directories and absolute paths in verification notes are ignored, machine-local
evidence. Transfer a needed bundle with its manifest, checksums, configuration, and provenance intact.

## Current source verification

The checkout-independent command was:

```bash
uv run --locked pytest orchestration/tests artifacts/tests companion/tests \
  ardupilot_sitl/tests gazebo/tests electromagnet/tests scorekeeper/tests tests/contracts \
  tests/integration/test_phase2_runtime_contract.py tests/integration/test_phase3_runtime_contract.py -q
```

Controller verification reported `1846 passed, 26 skipped, 48 failed in 112.67s`.
Independent Task 14 review reproduced those counts and classification in `77.41s`;
wall duration is host-dependent. Every failure came from the absent `companion/comp2026`
dependency or a consequence, so this is not a full pass. The prior baseline was `1841 passed, 26 skipped, 49 failed`; its unrelated ABA timing flake did not recur.

`uv lock --check`, full-source `compileall`, the corrected deletion audit, and
`git diff --check` passed. No container, image, or physical integration check ran.

| **Total** | **+498/-762, net -264** |

Independent task reviews 1-14 and final Standards/Spec reviews passed after
scoped review fixes; no Critical, Important, or Minor findings remain.

## Image and runtime boundary

No image was rebuilt or retagged. Existing tags predate these changes and are
stale and unrun for this revision. This worktree has no `companion/comp2026`;
no symlink was created and no Phase 3 build was claimed.

Campaign outcomes are separate: physical mission `not run`; score `not produced`;
artifact validity `not evaluated`; images `not rebuilt`. Source tests do not change them.

## Active priorities

1. Make acquisition and pinning of the separate Comp2026 mission reproducible.
   Publish an accessible intended revision and choose a submodule or explicit
   acquisition method. Do not invent a remote or bypass the revision guard.
2. Diagnose the historical range-stream sample loss, then obtain a fresh pinned,
   full-window competition baseline. Check physical behavior, score, and artifact
   validity separately while keeping the timestamp and physical checks strict.

Lower-priority work remains deferred: improve zero-budget Compose timeout
diagnostics; freeze final flight-exchange counters; investigate rare process and
session races; expand malformed-input, network, and multi-vehicle stress tests;
make rendering hosts reproducible; and add later-command simulation-time
rendezvous where required.

## Preservation warning

Preserve `runs/`, ArduPilot parameters, Gazebo resources and textures, provenance
and licenses, Compose/image configuration, and the independent mission repository.
A source edit does not rebuild an image. Before cleanup or integration, check both
Git statuses and keep evidence tied to its source revisions and image digests.
