Audited 2026-09-11. The fast precision-landing recovery is implemented and
verified by fresh automatic run `b3dfad75-4630-4233-84e3-836943459903`, which completed the
600-second window with accepted terminal artifacts and a 150/150 score.

The guarded QGC foundation is source-tested for FM1 and FM2 only. It pins
Copter 4.5.7 commit `2a3dc4b7bf2507120f7378a7b2fde73185e0c325`, uses staged
telemetry startup for paused simulation, and keeps FM3 and camera construction
disabled. No image or live QGC/SITL flight matching the integrated tree has
passed. Do not treat the automatic 150/150 run as QGC-path evidence.

## Maintainer start

Read the architecture map, then use the runbook for current setup, build, launch,
and acceptance commands. The tracked `companion/comp2026` source is included in
a fresh clone. Verify monorepo HEAD before a Phase 3 build; a mission log or
score alone is not a pass.

## Verified behavior and limits

| Evidence | Physical mission | Score | Terminal artifacts | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Accepted competition baseline](verification/comp2026-mvp.md), run `3dc895c3-a5aa-4651-a893-d21884fa43f5` | Returned Home and disarmed in the accepted 600-second run | 150/150 | `COMPLETED`; accepted bundle | Historical external evidence; does not prove current source or images |
| [Payload timestamp verification](payload-timestamp-fix.md), run `259863d9-c558-4102-ae34-fe6c31f5cf94` | Completed all three payloads and Home | 150/150 | `FAILED`; terminal artifacts invalid after a later downward-range timestamp/grid fault | Proves the recorded physical flight, not a full-window pass |
| Fast precision-landing recovery, run `b3dfad75-4630-4233-84e3-836943459903` | Payload 2 released; payloads 3 and 4 attached, lifted, and released; Home disarmed and completed at 261.15 s | 150/150 | `COMPLETED`; canonical semantic acceptance passed; manifest SHA-256 `9ed6496414746e76d2e146128d5055e95a2a2c219c6ece83d724add9040e85a7` | Machine-local run directory; preserve the complete bundle when transferring |

Run directories and absolute paths in verification notes are ignored, machine-local
evidence. Transfer a needed bundle with its manifest, checksums, configuration, and provenance intact.

## Current source verification

The integrated source tree passed 2,440 parent tests with 27 ROS-only skips and
all 1,126 nested Comp2026 tests. `uv lock --check` also passed. No image was
built and no live QGC/SITL flight was run for this merge.

Before this merge, focused verification for the precision-landing branch passed
171 host companion and ArduPilot tests and 81 nested mission tests. That accepted
Copter 4.7 run used `LAND_SPD_MS=0.50`. The integrated Copter 4.5.7 source
expresses the same target as `LAND_SPEED=50` cm/s and preserves the promoted
AutoTune gains under the older parameter names. The nested mission uses atomic camera observations, validates
the live profile, fixes a five-frame median anchor, holds and reacquires in
GUIDED, and retries acquisition once before failing closed. Below
`PLND_ALT_MIN=0.75`, it keeps LAND active without requiring marker visibility so
the normal near-ground loss of the marker cannot interrupt touchdown.

The first fresh attempt, `3db34962-84ad-44cd-bc51-bfbdfc585fba`, exposed that
near-ground edge case: target 3 left the camera view at about 0.095 m AGL, the
controller entered GUIDED hold, retried, and failed FM3_3. The solution mirrors
ArduPilot's precision floor in the companion and is covered by a regression
test. In the accepted rerun, target 3 and target 4 both logged the handoff below
0.75 m and physically attached without a recovery retry.

Both accepted videos are H.264, 640x480 at 20 fps, with exactly 12,000 frames
and 600 seconds duration. DataFlash recorded the exact guarded profile. Across
471 acquired-target attitude samples, desired roll/pitch stayed within
0.67/0.31 degrees and actual roll/pitch within 0.77/0.25 degrees.

The earlier cleanup-branch verification below remains historical context:

The checkout-independent command was:

```bash
uv run --locked pytest orchestration/tests artifacts/tests companion/tests \
  ardupilot_sitl/tests gazebo/tests electromagnet/tests scorekeeper/tests tests/contracts \
  tests/integration/test_phase2_runtime_contract.py tests/integration/test_phase3_runtime_contract.py -q
```

Controller verification reported `1846 passed, 26 skipped, 48 failed in 112.67s`.
Independent Task 14 review reproduced those counts and classification in `77.41s`;
wall duration is host-dependent. Every failure came from the absent `companion/comp2026`
dependency or a consequence, so this is not a full pass. The prior baseline was `1841 passed, 26 skipped, 49 failed`; its unrelated ABA timing flake did not recur.

`uv lock --check`, full-source `compileall`, the corrected deletion audit, and
`git diff --check` passed. No container, image, or physical integration check ran.

Independent task reviews 1-14 and final Standards/Spec reviews passed after
scoped review fixes; no Critical, Important, or Minor findings remain.

## Image and runtime boundary

No image was rebuilt or retagged. Existing tags predate these changes and are
stale and unrun for this revision. That cleanup worktree had no
`companion/comp2026`; no symlink was created and no Phase 3 build was claimed.

Campaign outcomes are separate: physical mission `not run`; score `not produced`;
artifact validity `not evaluated`; images `not rebuilt`. Source tests do not change them.

## Active priorities

1. Complete the remaining guarded QGC FM3, camera, attachment, event, and
   operator-workflow tasks, then obtain a fresh pinned QGC-path 150/150 run.
   Check physical behavior, score, and artifact validity separately.

Lower-priority work remains deferred: improve zero-budget Compose timeout
diagnostics; freeze final flight-exchange counters; investigate rare process and
session races; expand malformed-input, network, and multi-vehicle stress tests;
make rendering hosts reproducible; and add later-command simulation-time
rendezvous where required.

## Preservation warning

Preserve `runs/`, ArduPilot parameters, Gazebo resources and textures,
provenance, licenses, Compose/image configuration, and imported mission history.
A source edit does not rebuild an image. Before cleanup or integration, check
Git status and keep evidence tied to its source revisions and image digests.
