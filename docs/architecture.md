This is a responsibility map, not an exhaustive ROS topic diagram. The physical
runtime uses seven services from [compose.yaml](../compose.yaml). `phase3` means
the real Gazebo/SITL stack here, including the mission and scorer; it does not
mean that flight control is still unimplemented. `phase2` uses synthetic peers
to exercise lifecycle and recording infrastructure.

## Follow one run

1. The host CLI resolves a template, assigns a run ID, records configuration and
   source provenance, and starts prebuilt images in an isolated Compose project.
2. Runtime processes establish actual endpoint readiness. Gazebo/SITL perform
   private warmup before the public simulation epoch is released. Public time
   starts at zero; warmup is not a payload mission phase.
3. The companion executes mission logic from its nested checkout. Camera/range
   data enters through the host adapter; vehicle commands go through MAVLink.
4. ArduPilot executes flight control; Gazebo determines movement and payload
   attachment. A mission command or an accepted service request is not proof of
   a physical pickup. Inspect payload height, attachment, release, and settlement.
5. The scorer reads events and physical states. Artifacts records evidence.
   Flight completion, score, and complete/valid artifacts are separate outcomes.
6. At finalization, publishers stop, recorders drain and close, and the host
   validates and commits `manifest.json`. Its terminal state is the run result.

Gazebo owns simulation time. Wall-clock deadlines detect infrastructure stalls;
they do not advance the mission. The public camera/state grid is 50 ms (20 Hz).
Slow rendering can make a short simulated mission take a long time in reality.

## Where to read or change code

Start with the module relevant to your task. Each guide links its executable
interfaces, implementation entry points, tests, and important constraints.

| Module guide | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| [Orchestration](../orchestration/README.md) | Host CLI, run lifecycle, readiness, finalization, terminal manifest |
| [Artifacts](../artifacts/README.md) | Video/bag recording, checksums, artifact validation |
| [Companion](../companion/README.md) | Mission selection, nested mission integration, sensors and MAVLink commands |
| [ArduPilot SITL](../ardupilot_sitl/README.md) | Flight-control process, transport, persistent parameter overlay |
| [Gazebo](../gazebo/README.md) | Physics, models, native/public time, camera/range and physical payload truth |
| [Electromagnet](../electromagnet/README.md) | Payload requests and physically confirmed events |
| [Scorekeeper](../scorekeeper/README.md) | Read-only competition evaluation and evidence-linked points |

## Shared communication guarantees

ROS messages/services define the wire format; the linked module guides identify
producers, consumers, and their endpoint QoS. Public physical positions use ENU.
Gazebo rebases native timestamps onto the public epoch; the first 20 Hz camera
sample is at 50 ms with frame ID zero. Do not substitute wall time for simulation
time or hide gaps by restamping queued samples. Run IDs isolate streams; invalid
ordering or missing required samples fail validation rather than proving success.
Reliable transport with bounded history is not a guarantee of lossless recording.

A payload request is intent, not physical success. Electromagnet waits for the
matching Gazebo confirmation; exact duplicate requests are idempotent and
conflicting reuse of an ID is rejected. Recurring physical payload state, not a
service response, establishes actual attachment and lift.

Finalization is a file-backed handshake: a finalize request leads to publisher
quiescence, a runtime-frozen marker, closed artifacts and an artifacts-final
record, then the host's terminal manifest/commit marker. Read the
[orchestration](../orchestration/README.md) and [artifacts](../artifacts/README.md)
guides before changing this ordering. A landed vehicle is not a terminal run.

## Sources of truth

| Question | Inspect |
| --- | --- |
| What will the next default mission run? | [default-run.json](../config/default-run.json), then [config validation](../orchestration/src/orchestration/config.py) |
| Where are the course and targets? | [course.yaml](../config/course.yaml), [scenario.yaml](../config/scenario.yaml), and the selected Gazebo world/model resources |
| What flight parameters survive a new container? | [descent.parm](../ardupilot_sitl/params/descent.parm) and its load path in [SITL config](../ardupilot_sitl/src/drone_sim_ardupilot/config.py); rebuild the SITL image after changing them |
| What gets copied into the mission image? | [companion Dockerfile](../companion/Dockerfile) and the allowlist in [.dockerignore](../.dockerignore), not the entire nested repository |
| What are the wire schemas? | [ROS messages/services](../ros_ws/src/simulation_interfaces), with QoS at the actual publisher/subscriber and [recording overrides](../artifacts/recording-qos.yaml) |
| What counts for points? | [versioned rules](../scorekeeper/rules) and scorer implementation; never the mission's success print alone |
| Which code/images produced an old result? | That run's `configuration/run.json`, manifest source revisions/image digests, and logs; mutable local Docker tags and today's Git HEAD are not historical evidence |
| Which topics are actually in the bag? | `BASE_TOPICS` / `COMPETITION_TOPICS` in the [bag adapter](../artifacts/src/artifacts/_adapters/rosbag.py) |

The bag stores camera **metadata**, not raw image pixels. The MP4s are the image
recordings; a bag cannot recreate a lost recording. Private Gazebo topics also
are not automatically included in the public evidence bag.

Course YAML is not a dynamic world editor. Gazebo uses checked-in generated SDF
and assets, while mission/policy code reads configuration and validators enforce
fixed competition values. A geometry change must keep those representations
aligned; start at [prepare_competition_assets.py](../gazebo/scripts/prepare_competition_assets.py)
and [competition_config.py](../gazebo/src/drone_sim_gazebo/competition_config.py).

## Boundaries to preserve

- Mission intent belongs to the companion, flight execution to ArduPilot, and
  physical outcomes to Gazebo. Do not fix missed pickups by editing the scorer.
- Electromagnet coordinates payload actions through Gazebo's public interface;
  it does not directly edit the aircraft state.
- Scorekeeper is read-only. Payload IDs **2, 3, 4** mean the first, second, and
  third payloads respectively; marker 4 is not a fourth payload. The first
  payload starts attached in the competition model; the other two require pickup.
- Preserve run evidence. Do not rewrite a manifest or remove timestamp checks to
  turn a diagnostic failure into a passing run.
- A source edit is not an image update. Source provenance, image build identity,
  and runtime evidence must agree before claiming a verified result.
